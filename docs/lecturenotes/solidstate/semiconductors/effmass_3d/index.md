# Three-dimensional periodic primitive-cell effective-mass reference

This model applies the conventions reviewed in two dimensions to a physical
three-dimensional primitive cell. It is an exact reciprocal-space reference
for geometry, Bloch modes, units, Cartesian effective mass, and volume
normalization. It is not a DFT implementation and does not replace Quantum
ESPRESSO.

## Geometry and reciprocal modes

Let the columns of $A$ be three physical primitive vectors and define

$$
B=2\pi A^{-\mathsf T},
\qquad
A^{\mathsf T}B=2\pi I.
$$

For $\mathbf n\in\mathbb Z^3$ and Cartesian Bloch vector $\mathbf k$,

$$
\mathbf q_{\mathbf n}=\mathbf k+B\mathbf n.
$$

The primitive-cell volume is $\Omega=|\det A|$.

## Effective-mass energy

The Cartesian mass tensor $M$ is symmetric positive definite. The exact model
energy is

$$
E_{\mathbf n}(\mathbf k)
=
\frac{\hbar^2}{2}
\mathbf q_{\mathbf n}^{\mathsf T}M^{-1}\mathbf q_{\mathbf n}.
$$

A simultaneous Cartesian rotation of $A$, $M$, and $\mathbf k$ leaves this
energy invariant. Integer reciprocal labels remain separate from Cartesian
wave vectors.

## Metal units

The maintained implementation uses the selected physical `UnitSystem`; the
research-facing laboratory selects `UnitSystem.METAL`:

- direct lengths in angstrom;
- particle masses in dalton;
- time in picosecond;
- action in electron-volt picosecond; and
- energies in electron-volt.

The evaluator explicitly converts the compound represented unit to
electron-volts.

## Normalized plane waves

The cell-normalized modes are

$$
\psi_{\mathbf n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)
=
\Omega^{-1/2}e^{i\mathbf q_{\mathbf n}\cdot\mathbf r},
$$

with amplitude units of inverse length to the power $3/2$. They satisfy

$$
\int_\Omega |\psi|^2\,d^3r=1
$$

and the Bloch primitive-translation condition.

## Evidence boundary

The implementation has software and numerical-verification tests for
reciprocal duality, the zero mode, opposite-mode degeneracy, independent SI
energy agreement, Cartesian rotation invariance, normalization, and primitive
translation phase. Synthetic laboratory values are illustrative. They are not
literature values, fitted semiconductor parameters, or scientific validation.
