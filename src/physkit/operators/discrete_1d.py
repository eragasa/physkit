"""Abstract finite-matrix operators on one-dimensional state spaces.

:class:`DiscreteLinearOperator1D` specializes
:class:`~physkit.operators.base.LinearOperator` by requiring a canonical SciPy
CSR matrix.  Dense inspection is derived from the public defensive CSR copy,
not from an independent representation, and returns owned C-contiguous data.
Concrete subclasses define semantic domain/codomain validation, matrix sign,
shape, and dtype.

This module introduces no grid, boundary condition, stencil, composition, or
physical model.  Matrix inspection alone provides neither numerical nor
physical validation, pedagogical acceptance, nor uncertainty quantification.
